This is a simple and straightforward J2ME music player, with equalizer, touch support and color customization. It was created as an attempt to overcome the limitations of my Nokia 3120 classic's native player.

This is an Eclipse project, and it is necessary to have ProGuard 4.6, or newer, installed, in order to generate a jar file as the one in the "deployed" folder. Check out Application Descriptor for a list of all the configurations that go in the companion jad file.

Unfortunately, due to security restrictions in some mobiles, everyday usage of this player could be very prejudiced, as it tries to access folders' contents for listing purposes.

All the classes, methods and variables are in English, but all the strings are in Portuguese... I never took the time to translate them... ;)
